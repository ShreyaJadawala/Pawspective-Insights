Step 1A: Define Project Scope
The project scope should comprehensively describe the functionalities, user interactions, and system capabilities. Here's how to define it:

Core Functionalities Outline

User Authentication: Secure system where users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
Image Upload and Processing: Users upload images of dogs, which are processed by a machine learning model to classify emotions and breeds.
Database Interactions: Store and retrieve user data, images, model predictions, and feedback securely.
System Requirements Specification (SRS) Document

Purpose: Define the purpose of the system, including its intended audience and why it is needed.
System Overview: Provide a high-level view of the system features and operations.
Functional Requirements: List all the operations the system must perform, detailed for each user role.
Non-functional Requirements: Describe the system's performance, security, and user interface requirements.
Example of a Functional Requirement (User Authentication)

Copy code
- **Requirement ID**: FR1
- **Description**: The system must allow users to create a new account using their email address and password.
- **Functionality**:
  - Users can register by providing an email, password, and confirming their password.
  - Passwords must be securely hashed before storing in the database.
  - The system should verify that the email address is not already in use.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - A new user account is created upon successful registration.
  - An error message is displayed if the email is already in use or the passwords do not match.
Step 1B: Set Milestones
Creating a timeline with clear milestones is crucial for keeping the project on track. Each milestone should include specific tasks and deadlines.

Project Timeline Creation

Use tools like Gantt charts to visually plan the project phases.
Define the start and end dates for each phase of the project development.
Milestone Breakdown

Initial Setup: Environment setup, project structure initialization.
Core Feature Development: Implementing authentication, image upload, model integration.
Model Integration: Integrating and tuning the machine learning models for emotion and breed detection.
Testing and Deployment: Conducting thorough testing and deploying the application.
